ANN Encyclopedia Staff Graph Script
===================================

Python script `tools.py` is fairly well documented and has functions for making ANN API requests, making a JSON dataset, and building a networkx.Graph graph object. Python package requirements are in `requirements.txt`.

If you want support, contact me. No promises.
